This project was done as an academic project by students in Final Project at Full Sail University. The team consisted of seven programmers and five artists, and was completed in a five month development cycle.

While making this game, we experimented with several technologies that were new to us. The first of which is a component-based architecture. Although we had never implemented anything like this before, we taught ourselves as we went. Another piece of new technology was the use of a navigation mesh for our AI pathfinding. Other things we experimented with include batched rendering, instanced geometry, event-driven architecture, and the use of Lua. If some codes appears sloppy or unreadable, we apologize. We were students venturing in unknown territory at the time.
